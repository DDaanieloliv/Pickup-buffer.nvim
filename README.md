# PupV2.nvim

A personal plugin that helps me switch between buffers in Neovim and handle them per working directory.

## Features

- Path-aware caching: Buffers are organized by project directory

- Persistent cache: Your buffer history survives Neovim sessions

- Automatic cleanup: Removes invalid buffers and maintains organization

## Overview

The main motivation is to provide an "environment" with buffers that I often use in my projects.
Making it easier to navigate between them and search for them.

## Dependecies

To use the telescope options like, <leader>ls you should using the plugin ['telescope.nvim'](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).

## Installation

- Using Packer.nvim

```lua
use {
  'DDaanieloliv/Pupv2.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('pupV2').setup()
  end
}
```

- Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  'DDaanieloliv/Pupv2.nvim',
  config = true,
}
```

### How to start

- Use `:Mag` to open the buffer menu.<br>

### User interface

A floating window displays your buffers in chronological order. Features include:

- **Smart Positioning**: Appears at bottom-left corner for easy access
- **Visual Feedback**: Vertical bar indicates current input position  
- **Real-time Filtering**: Start typing to instantly filter buffers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Multiple keybinding options for different workflows

  
### Usage cycle

- **Basic Navigation**:
  - `J`/`<C-n>` - Move selection down
  - `K`/`<C-p>` - Move selection up
  - `<Tab>` - Cycle through buffers
  - `<Enter>`/`<Space>`/`O`/`<C-l>` - Open selected buffer
  - `<Esc>` - Close window

- **Direct Access**:
  - `Alt+1` to `Alt+9` - Jump to buffer 1-9 directly
  - Type numbers - Select buffer by index
 
  

## Default config

- Default configuration (customize as needed):

```lua
require('pupV2').setup({
  enabled = true,
  cache_dir = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/buffer_cache",
  keymaps = {
    list_buffers = "<leader>ls",
    move_backward = "<leader>[",
    move_forward = "<leader>]", 
    buffer_picker = "รง",
    close_buffer = "<leader>q",
    clear_path = "<leader>x",
    remove_last = "<leader>r",
    clear_cache = "<leader>cc"
  },
  ignore_patterns = {
    "neo%-tree", "NvimTree", "packer", "fugitive", "term://", "^no name"
  }
})
```


## Keybindings


- Navigation

```Key	Action
<leader>bf	Open floating buffer picker
<A-1> to <A-9>	Open buffer 1-9 directly
รง	Open buffer command palette
<leader>ls	List all cached buffers
```

- Buffer Management

```Key	Action
<leader>q	Close current buffer (smart)
<leader>[	Move buffer backward in list
<leader>]	Move buffer forward in list
<leader>x	Clear current path buffers
<leader>r	Remove last buffer from cache
<leader>cc	Clear entire buffer cache
```

- Floating Window Controls

```Key	Action
J/<C-j>	Move selection down
K/<C-k>	Move selection up
1-9	Select buffer by number
TAB	Cycle through buffers
Space/Enter/O/<C-l>	Confirm selection
ESC	Close without selection
Type any letter	Real-time filtering
```

- Customization
UI Customization
The floating window uses these highlight groups:
vim

" Customize the appearance:
highlight FloatCursorLine guibg=#312f2d
highlight PickBufferMatch guifg=#9484D2 gui=bold
highlight PickBufferMatchCurrent guifg=#FF6B6B gui=bold

Path Truncation

The plugin truncates long paths:

```lua
-- Example: 
-- Original: /home/user/projects/long-project-name/src/components/very-long-component-name.lua
-- Truncated: ~/proj...ong-project-name/src/components/very-long-component-name.lua
```

## Others Usages

- Command Mode

```vim
:Mag 3           " Open buffer 3
:Mag filename    " Open buffer by name
:Mag            " Show interactive picker
```

- API Access
```lua
local pick_buffer = require('pick-buffer')
```

```lua
-- Get all buffers with numbers
local buffers = pick_buffer.get_buffers_with_numbers()
```

```lua
-- Programmatic buffer selection
pick_buffer.buffer_command("3")
```
